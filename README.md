## Abstract

Existing CS methods use simple convolutional downsampling and only refer to low-level information in the reconstruction optimization in the information domain, making it difﬁcult to utilize high-level features of the original signal. In deep reconstruction,they ignore the different importance of distinguishing high- and low-frequency information. 
To address the above issues, we propose MCFD Net, which employs a series of clever methods through experiments show that MCFD-Net signiﬁcantly outperforms state of-the-art CS methods in multiple benchmark datasets while achieving better noise robustness.

## Network Architecture
![structure](md_image/structure.png)

## Requirements (recommend)
- Python >= 3.9
- Pytorch >= 1.13
- Numpy >= 1.16


## Datasets
- Train data: [Train Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zUPKz06AhH8zOJBZDtWsxyEHJMt5t-OK/view) from COCO 2014 dataset.
- Test data: [Test Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-qAmy_9kTa2tOSlIMkWcSPwIDpKAzcIz/view) from Set5, Set11, BSDS200.
- You should decompress and place these datasets in the "./dataset/" directory.

## Pre training model
We provide [pre-trained weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N-B7NZI0HBHbkTbgZMvNczZpKsP6eDHO) for convenient evaluation. It contains six sampling rates.

## How To Run

### Test
1. Ensure the test dataset path in data_processor.py is correct
2. Run the following scripts to test MCFD-Net model:
```
python val.py --sensing-rate <0.015625/0.3125/0.0625/0.125/0.25/0.5>
```
3. The default parameter configuration will evaluate the model with a perception rate of 0.5:
```
python val.py
```


### Train

1. Ensure the train dataset path (train_40k) in data_processor.py is correct
2. Run the following scripts to train MCFD-Net model:
```
python train_mcfd.py --sensing-rate <0.015625/0.3125/0.0625/0.125/0.25/0.5> --epochs 100 --batch-size 4
```
1. The default parameters for training are as follows: learning rate = 0.5, batch size = 6, and number of epochs = 200:
```
python train_mcfd.py
```
